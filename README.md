# 📡 Cloud-Based RFID Attendance System

A secure, scalable, and cloud-connected RFID attendance system using **ESP32, MQTT, Raspberry Pi, and Google Sheets** for real-time attendance tracking.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Traditional attendance systems are time-consuming and prone to human error.  
This project implements an **automated RFID-based attendance system** with real-time cloud synchronization, local backup, and administrator control features.

---

## ⚙️ Working Principle

1. Student scans the RFID card  
2. ESP32 reads the RFID UID  
3. UID is published to the MQTT broker  
4. Raspberry Pi subscribes and receives the UID  
5. Attendance is stored in the local database  
6. Data is sent to Google Sheets using HTTP  
7. OLED display and LEDs provide visual feedback  

---

## 🔄 Operating Modes

### 👨‍🎓 Student Mode (Default)

- Students scan RFID cards  
- Attendance is marked automatically  
- OLED displays attendance status  
- LEDs indicate success or failure  

### 👨‍💻 Administrator Mode

- Used for system configuration and maintenance  
- Allows Wi-Fi configuration and student management  
- Provides access to system logs and status

## ⚙️ Configuration Mode (BOOT Button Method)

This system supports a **Configuration Mode** that is activated using the **ESP32 BOOT button (GPIO 0)** during power-up.  
This method is useful during **initial setup** or when **Wi-Fi credentials need to be updated**.

---

### 🔘 How to Enter Configuration Mode

1. Power **OFF** the ESP32 device  
2. **Press and HOLD** the **BOOT button**  
3. While holding the button, **Power ON / Reset** the device  
4. Keep holding for **2–3 seconds**  
5. Release the button  

➡️ The device will now start in **CONFIG MODE**

---

### 🧠 Configuration Mode Logic

- BOOT button (GPIO 0) is checked during startup  
- If the button is **LOW (pressed)** at boot time:
  - Device enters **Configuration Mode**
  - ESP32 starts in **Access Point (AP) mode**
  - OLED displays the **Configuration Screen**
- If the button is **not pressed**:
  - Device starts in **Normal (Student) Mode**

---

### 📟 OLED Display – Config Mode

When Configuration Mode is active, the OLED displays:
- **CONFIG MODE**
- **Access Point (AP) Name**
- **Device IP Address**
- Instructions to connect using a mobile or laptop

### 🌐 Configuration Features

In Configuration Mode, the administrator can:
- Configure **Wi-Fi SSID and Password**
- Save credentials to ESP32 flash memory (NVS)
- Restart the device after successful configuration

---

### 🔄 Exit Configuration Mode

- Restart the device **without pressing** the BOOT button  
- Device boots into **Student Mode** automatically  

---

## 🗄️ Database & Cloud Features

### 📍 Local Database

- Stores attendance during internet failure  
- Prevents data loss
